# Skaro

A silly [robots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots_(BSD_game))
game, implemented in Chicken Scheme and Clojure for comparison.

I wrote the Scheme version first, then did a fairly literal port to
Clojure, except obviously replacing the mutable parts with a
functional version.

Don't take it too seriously; I can't be trusted to write idiomatic Scheme.
